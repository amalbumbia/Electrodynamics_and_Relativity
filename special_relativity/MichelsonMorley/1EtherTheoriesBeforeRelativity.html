    <h1>Ether Theories Before Relativity and the Michelson-Morley Experiment</h1>
    <h1 id="before-relativity-the-luminiferous-ether">Before Relativity:
    The Luminiferous Ether</h1>
    <p>Prior to 1900, most known wave phenomena (aside from light) were
    physical, and were known to travel through physical media; more than
    that, their existence and traversal through those physical media
    could be derived directly from classical (Newtonian) theory. So when
    the wave nature of light became clear, many physicists
    understandably guessed that it also travelled through a medium. This
    medium couldn’t be quite the same as the known physical media of
    other waves (light was known to travel through a vacuum, among other
    things), and so (and as early as the 17th century) many proposed a
    “luminiferous ether” that permeated all of space, was of a
    negligible density, had a negligible interaction with matter, and
    only existed as the medium for light to travel. (By the late 19th
    century, when light’s existence as an electromagnetic phenomenon was
    understood, this ether would be expanded to account for the
    propagation of all electromagnetic waves.)</p>
    <p>This, of course, leads to some interesting conclusions about the
    behavior of light. The speed of a wave travelling through a medium
    is relative to the speed of the medium itself, and a wave of a
    certain wavelength and type always travels at the same speed in the
    galilean reference frame of the medium; when a stone splashes into a
    river, it produces circular ripples on the surface that move along
    with the flow of the surface of the river. This is all to say that,
    relative to an observer outside of the medium, a wave travels
    fastest in the direction of the medium’s flow and slowest in the
    direction opposite to the medium’s flow. Hence, if the otherwise
    undetectable ether is moving relative to an observer, and the ether
    behaves like known physical media in this respect, the observer
    should see that light travelling in certain directions is faster
    than in others. Thus, we should be able to perform a measurement of
    the speed of the ether relative to the observer, and test the ether
    theory, if we can measure the relative speed of light in different
    directions.</p>
    <p>This brings us to the Michelson-Morley experiment.</p>
    <h3 id="the-michelson-morley-experiment">The Michelson-Morley
    Experiment</h3>
    <p>When two or more waves overlap each other, they form an
    interference pattern governed in part by their phase relative to
    each other. As such, if we sets up a light source to send light out
    through a beamsplitter and down two orthogonal optical pathways of
    the same length, and merge them again at the end, like so:</p>
    <p><img src="MichelsonMorleyDesign.png"></p>
    <p>where <em>s</em> is the light source, <em>a</em> (and <span
    class="math inline">\(a_{1}\)</span>) is the beamsplitter(s), <span
    class="math inline">\(abad\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(acad\)</span> are the optical paths of the
    same length, and <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> is the
    target where the interference pattern appears, then any shift in the
    speed of light down one orthogonal path relative to the other will
    shift the relative phase of the beams, shifting the fringes on the
    interference pattern.</p>
    <p>If the ether flows at some velocity in the plane of the device,
    at some angle the flow will be in the direction of one of the
    orthogonal paths, and the speed will be faster down that path than
    the other; at some angle the flow will be in the direction of the
    other path, and which path is faster will be reversed; and at
    intermediate angles, the relative speed of light down each arm will
    shift between these two extremes. So if we rotate the device slowly,
    we should be able to measure a shift in the interference pattern as
    the angle of the device changes. If we know the usual wavelength and
    speed of the light used, we can use this measurement to calculate
    the speed of the ether in the plane of the device.</p>

    American physicists Albert A. Michelson (1852-1931) (left) and
    Edward W. Morley (1838-1923) (right)<sup>[6][7]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>This is the basic principle behind the design of Albert A.
    Michelson and Edward W. Morley’s famous interferometer in their 1887
    experiment (and, in fact, the above schematic comes from their 1887
    paper), where they used a version of this device to attempt to
    measure the speed of the ether relative to the surface of the
    Earth.</p>
    <p>As the speed of light is quite large, the speed of the ether was
    likely to be small relative to it, leading to comparatively minute
    changes in the velocity down each arm. To counter this, Michelson
    and Morley added a series of mirrors to increase the actual optical
    path length of each arm of the apparatus; an increase in the
    distance travelled by the light meant that smaller changes in speed
    would have a greater impact on the relative phase shift of the light
    by the time it reached the target, increasing the sensitivity of the
    device. To reduce vibrational noise and other external noise
    sources, while still allowing the full apparatus to rotate, they
    placed the full apparatus on a large stone block suspended in a pool
    of mercury. The design of the final device, and a picture thereof,
    are shown below.</p>
    <p><img src="MichelsonMorleySetup.png">
    <img src="Michelson_morley_experiment_1887.jpg"></p>
    <p>They then collected readings of the shifts in the interference
    fringes as the device rotated, in two batches—the first at noon, and
    the other at 6:00PM. This allowed them to collect data on the motion
    of the ether in two orthogonal planes, meaning that any motion of
    the ether in any direction relative to the Earth’s surface could be
    detected by the device.</p>
    <p>From this, they worked out the speed of the ether and found,
    astoundingly, found that the motion of the ether relative to the
    Earth was either extremely low or zero—but the ether theory wasn’t
    dead yet.</p>
    <h3 id="the-ether-drag-hypothesis">The Ether Drag Hypothesis</h3>
    <p><strong>Corpuscular Theory</strong></p>
    <p>A long competing theory of light to the ether theory was the
    <span class="math inline">\(corpuscular\)</span> <span
    class="math inline">\(theory\)</span>, which held that light
    consisted of a multitude of corpuscules (similar to particles, in
    the modern sense) radiating out from a light source. By this theory,
    the velocity of light varied not with the velocity of an intervening
    medium, but with the velocity of the source of emission.</p>
    <p align="center">
    <img src="François_Arago_by_Carl_von_Steuben.jpg" width="250">
    </p>
    <p align="center">
    French physicist François Arago (1786-1853)
    </p>
    <p>In 1810, François Arago developed an experiment to test this
    theory using the phenomenon of stellar aberration. It had long been
    observed that the apparent position of stars in the sky when viewed
    by a telescope shifted back and forth over a distance of 41
    arcseconds in total over the course of a year. This is due to the
    shift in the relative velocity of the Earth and the stars over the
    course of the Earth’s orbit; in the time it takes for the light to
    travel from the star to the telescope, the telescope will have
    shifted position by an amount relative to the Earth’s velocity, and
    so the image of the star will be shifted by a proportional amount.
    Arago reasoned, that if the corpuscular theory holds, when a
    material with a high refractive index (in his case, a prism) was
    placed between the star and the telescope, the degree of aberration
    should change when the telescope was pointed in the direction of
    Earth’s motion relative to the star compared to the opposite
    direction (as the speed of the light relative to the refractive
    medium would change, changing the degree to which the light was
    refracted.) However, when he performed the experiment, he found no
    difference in aberration depending on the direction of the
    telescope; a result that he felt he could not satisfactorily explain
    via the corpuscular theory. So he asked his colleague, Augustin-Jean
    Fresnell, if he could explain it using the wave (and hence ether)
    theory of light.</p>
    <p><strong>Partial Ether Drag Hypothesis</strong></p>
    <p align="center">
    <img src="Augustin_Fresnel.jpg" width="250">
    </p>
    <p align="center">
    French physicist Augustin Jean Fresnel (1788-1827)
    </p>
    <p>The ether theory of wave propagation of light definitely had an
    advantage over the corpuscular theory, as the velocity of light did
    not at all depend on the motion of the source of the light, but it
    produced a similar problem: as the Earth shifts the direction of its
    velocity over the course of its orbit, if the ether doesn’t interact
    with most physical matter directly at all, the velocity of the ether
    relative to the Earth should still be significant for at least some
    portion of the year. Hence, the ether theory would run into the same
    problem, that light should be faster, and thus refract more, in
    certain directions than in others. Even worse, as this difference in
    velocity would depend on the relative motion of the ether and not
    the source of the light, it should be imminently obvious <em>even
    when pointing a telescope through a refractive medium at anything at
    rest in the telescope’s frame of motion.</em> This was clearly not
    the case.</p>
    <p>But Fresnel found that a slight modification to the ether theory
    could rescue it entirely: if physical matter dragged a portion of
    the ether along with it, it would increase the relative density of
    the ether (and hence change the speed of light) within it,
    incidentally also lending a theoretical basis for their refractive
    index, <em>and</em> change the relative velocity of the ether within
    it to a proportion exactly counteracting the additional aberration
    expected from the relative speed of the ether external to the
    matter. This became known as the <em>partial ether drag
    hypothesis</em>.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, this still wouldn’t explain the null result of the
    Michelson-Morley experiment, as while the velocity of the ether in
    the air at the surface of the Earth would be shifted by the velocity
    of the air, the ether would <em>still</em> have an internal velocity
    in the air itself relative to the apparatus, and so the experiment
    should have picked up some kind of motion in the ether.</p>
    <p><strong>Complete Ether Drag Hypothesis</strong></p>
    <p align="center">
    <img src="Ggstokes.jpg" width="250">
    </p>
    <p align="center">
    Irish physicist George Gabriel Stokes (1819-1903)<sup>[6]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>This problem could be solved if, as George Stokes supposed in
    1845, instead of partially dragging the ether, matter dragged the
    ether completely. Then there would be no relative velocity of the
    ether in the air around the apparatus, leading to the
    Michelson-Morley experiment’s null result, nor would there be a
    relative velocity dependent on the direction of the telescope with
    the prism, as in Arago’s experiment. Unfortunately, this also means
    that the velocity of the Earth relative to the stars would also not
    properly predict stellar aberration. (Stokes attempted to come up
    with a variety of solutions to this problem, but all ultimately ran
    into some problem or another.)</p>
    <p>So the partial drag hypothesis accounted for stellar aberration
    perfectly well, but was thrown out by the Michelson-Morley result,
    and the complete drag hypothesis accounted for the Michelson result,
    but not a variety of other factors. To account for all of the known
    properties of light with the ether theory, physicists needed to come
    up with some other way to account for both stellar aberration and
    the result of the Michelson-Morley expleriment.</p>
    <h3 id="lorentz-contraction">Lorentz Contraction</h3>
    <p align="center">
    <img src="Hendrik_Antoon_Lorentz.jpg" width="250">
    </p>
    <p align="center">
    Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz (1853-1928)<sup>[8]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>From 1890 to 1904, Lorentz formulated a set of equations that
    could account for the then-known properties of light in the ether
    theory. He found that, when working from Maxwell’s equations, and
    taking both the speed of light in the ether and the velocity of the
    matter in question relative to the ether into account, the
    transformations between reference frames could be made simpler by
    introducing a <em>local time</em> of the system, separate but
    dependent on the <em>universal time</em> external to the system.
    (This idea can be seen as a sort of precursor to time dilation in
    special relativity.)</p>
    <p>To account for the null result of the Michelson-Morley
    experiment, Lorentz also hypothesized that matter travelling through
    the ether experiences a <em>length contraction</em> proportional
    to</p>
    <p><span
    class="math inline">\(\sqrt{1-{\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\)</span></p>
    <p>where <em>v</em> is the speed of the matter and <em>c</em> the
    speed of light through the ether.</p>
    <p>Ignoring length contraction, let’s take a look at the
    Michelson-Morley interferometer. Denoting the length of each arm
    <span class="math inline">\(L_{0}\)</span>, and setting the
    direction of the velocity of the ether to be directly down one of
    the arms, we find that <span class="math inline">\(T_{1}\)</span>,
    the time taken to travel down and back the arm parallel to the
    velocity through the ether, is</p>
    <p><span
    class="math inline">\(T_{1}=\frac{L_{0}}{c-v}+\frac{L_{0}}{c+v}=\frac{2L_{0}c}{c^2-v^2}=\frac{2L_{0}}{c(1-\frac{v^2}{c^2})}\)</span></p>
    <p>and <span class="math inline">\(T_{2}\)</span>, the time taken to
    travel down the perpindicular arm, is</p>
    <p><span
    class="math inline">\(T_{2}=\frac{2L_{0}}{\sqrt{c^2-v^2}}\)</span></p>
    <p>which is clearly different, leading to the phase shift that
    Michelson and Morley expected.</p>
    <p>Now, modifying the length of the arms with Lorentz’s contraction
    factor, we find that <span class="math inline">\(T_{2}\)</span> is
    unchanged, while <span class="math inline">\(T_{1}\)</span>
    becomes</p>
    <p><span
    class="math inline">\(T_{1}=\sqrt{1-{\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\frac{2L_{0}}{c(1-\frac{v^2}{c^2})}=\frac{2L_{0}}{\sqrt{c^2-v^2}}=T_{2}\)</span></p>
    <p>leading to the lack of a phase shift in the experiment
    <em>without</em> necessitating the abandonment of the ether theory.
    It also had the added benefit of more accurately matching observed
    stellar aberrations.</p>
    <p>But once again unfortunately for the ether theory, Lorentz’s
    modification too had a fatal flaw: it priveleges one reference
    frame, that of the ether itself, above all others, and his
    transformations hence are not quite equivalent when jumping from one
    non-ethereal reference frame to another. The ether theory, at the
    time, could yet have been proven correct, but later experiment would
    show no such priveleged reference frame. This brings us to the final
    nail in the coffin of the ether theory.</p>
    <h3 id="einsteins-theory-of-special-relativity">Einstein’s Theory of
    Special Relativity</h3>
    <p align="center">
    <img src="Albert_Einstein_sticks_his_tongue_1951.jpg" width="250">
    </p>
    <p align="center">
    Albert Einstein (1879-1955)<sup>[9]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>In 1905, Albert Einstein published his paper outlining his theory
    of special relativity. He began with two postulates:</p>
    <p><strong>1. The principle of relativity:</strong> The same laws of
    physics apply in all inertial reference systems. <strong>2. The
    universal speed of light:</strong> The speed of light in a vacuum is
    the same for all inertial observers, regardless of the motion of the
    source.</p>
    <p>From this he derived a time dilation factor proportional to <span
    class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\)</span>,
    and the familiar length contraction factor first introduced by
    Lorentz. This theory accounted for almost all of the discrepancy
    between the ether theory and the then-known properties of light (and
    many of the properties of light determined experimentally, though
    not all—one notable exception being its quantization), all without
    requiring a priveleged reference frame or the ether. This brings us
    to the rest of our project.</p>
