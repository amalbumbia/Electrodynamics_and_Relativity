    <h3 id="ladder-barn-paradox">Ladder-Barn Paradox</h3>
    <p>I’m sure many reading this article are already familiar with the
    ladder-barn paradox, whereby a ladder moving at near the speed of
    light appears to fit into the barn in the barn’s reference frame,
    but does not fit into the barn in it’s own reference frame, but I
    will reiterate it here.</p>
    <p><img src="./pictures/LB01.png" width="250"></p>
    <p>Suppose you have a ladder slightly longer than the length of a
    barn (let’s say 4/3 of the barn’s length), and you want to find a
    way to fit it into the barn. You remember that objects travelling
    near the speed of light experience Lorentz contraction, so if you
    move the ladder into the barn fast enough (let’s say .8c), you feel
    you should be able to fit the ladder into the barn and close the
    door.</p>
    <p>In your reference frame, the ladder, as the moving object, will
    be contracted by the factor</p>
    <p><span
    class="math inline">\(\sqrt{1-{\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}=\sqrt{1-{.8^2}}=.6\)</span></p>
    <p>and so it’s length as a portion of the barn’s length will become
    <span class="math inline">\(\frac{4}{3}(.6)=\frac{4}{5}\)</span> of
    the barn’s length, and hence will fit in the barn. So, your
    reasoning goes, the ladder will enter the barn fully, and then you
    will close the barn door, and then the ladder will be in the barn.
    And that seems all well and good. So what happens in the ladder’s
    reference frame?</p>
    <p>Well, now it is not the ladder that is moving, but the barn; so
    instead of the ladder contracting, the barn will contract—so the
    ladder will go from <span class="math inline">\(\frac{4}{3}\)</span>
    of the barn’s length to <span
    class="math inline">\(\frac{20}{9}\)</span> of the barn’s length,
    and will therefore be even less likely to fit into the barn.</p>
    <p>In the barn’s reference frame, the ladder will fit into the barn;
    but in the ladder’s reference frame, the ladder will <em>never</em>
    fit into the barn. So how do we resolve this?</p>
    <p>Let’s say the barn is 10m long, start the x-axis at the entrance
    of the barn, and set the time that the front of the ladder crosses
    the threshold is at <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span>. In the
    barn’s reference frame, the front of the ladder enters the barn at
    <span class="math inline">\(t=0s\)</span>, then the back end of the
    ladder enters the barn at about <span
    class="math inline">\(t=33ns\)</span>, then the barn door closes
    (then the front of the ladder hits the rear of the barn at about
    <span class="math inline">\(t=42ns\)</span>).</p>
    <p><img src="./pictures/LadderBarn1.png"></p>
    <p>But in the ladder’s reference frame, the effect of time dilation
    changes the order of events. Time dilation follows the equation</p>
    <p><span
    class="math inline">\(t=\gamma(t&#39;+\frac{v}{c^2}x&#39;)\)</span></p>
    <p>where <span class="math inline">\(x&#39;\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(t&#39;\)</span> are the proper length and
    proper time, respectively (and <span
    class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is the factor <span
    class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-{\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}}\)</span>).
    In the ladder’s frame, the barn is moving at <span
    class="math inline">\(-.8c\)</span>; in the barn’s frame, the time
    the ladder hits the rear of the barn is <span
    class="math inline">\(t&#39;=42ns\)</span>, and the position of the
    rear of the barn is <span class="math inline">\(x&#39;=10m\)</span>,
    so the equation for the time the ladder hits the rear of the barn in
    the ladder’s frame becomes:</p>
    <p><span
    class="math inline">\(t=\gamma(42ns-\frac{.8c}{c^2}10m)=25ns\)</span></p>
    <p>Similarly, the time the back end of the ladder enters the barn /
    the barn door closes in the ladder’s frame becomes:</p>
    <p><span
    class="math inline">\(t=\gamma(33ns-\frac{.8c}{c^2}(0m))=56ns\)</span></p>
    <p><img src="./pictures/LadderBarn2.png"></p>
    <p>That is, the ladder hits the end of the barn <em>before</em> the
    barn door closes. So who’s right? Special relativity does not
    priveledge any reference frame over any other, so neither is more
    correct than the other; more precisely, they’re <em>both</em>
    correct. If this seems strange to you, consider the following:</p>
    <p>You cannot stop the ladder from hitting the back wall once it
    enters the barn. If this, too, seems strange, remember what has to
    happen for the ladder to turn around. It cannot instantaneously
    change direction to head backwards; it must slow down, then stop,
    then speed up in the opposite direction. Hence, there must be a
    point where the ladder is completely stopped; a moment where Lorentz
    contraction no longer applies to it, even in the barn’s frame. Once
    it has passed the point where, in its own reference frame, it has
    hit the back of the barn, it has also gotten close enough to the
    back in the barn’s reference frame that even an instantaneous stop
    would result in the ladder suddenly accordioning out like a cartoon
    and smashing the barn’s wall to smithereens.</p>
    <p>So, while the ordering of events, and what an observer sees, can
    be quite different in different reference frames, both frames agree
    on the ultimate outcome of this sequence of events; your barn will
    be about as totaled as a barn can be.</p>
    <p>So what happens, if, instead of a barn with a single entrance, we
    try to pass the ladder through a tunnel?</p>
    <h3 id="ladder-tunnel-paradox">Ladder-Tunnel Paradox</h3>
    <p>Suppose we take a ladder of the same length, and a tunnel of the
    same length as the barn, send the ladder throiugh the tunnel at the
    same speed as in the previous example, and, at the moment the ladder
    is fully in the tunnel in our reference frame, simultaneously close
    both entrances and then instantaneously open them again. What
    happens now?</p>
    <p>Given the result of the ladder with the barn, one may be inclined
    to believe that the ladder will be fine in the tunnel’s reference
    frame, but be destroyed in its own frame; or perhaps it will be
    destroyed in both frames. But neither is the case; the ladder will
    pass fully through the tunnel, unharmed, in both cases.</p>
    <p>Here, the supposed paradox is resolved by the aforementioned lack
    of simultaneity. As can be expected, in the tunnel’s reference
    frame, the front of the ladder enters the tunnel at time <span
    class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span>. Then the back half of the ladder
    enters the tunnel at about <span
    class="math inline">\(t=33ns\)</span>, and the entrances
    simultaneously close, then open.</p>
    <p><img src="./pictures/LadderTunnel1.png"></p>
    <p>In the ladder’s reference frame, the front half of the ladder
    enters the tunnel at time <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span>.
    But now, the door at the end of the tunnel closes and opens at
    time</p>
    <p><span
    class="math inline">\(t=\gamma(33ns-\frac{.8c}{c^2}(10m))=9.7ns\)</span></p>
    <p>Then the front of the ladder exits the tunnel at about <span
    class="math inline">\(t=25ns\)</span>, then the back end of the
    ladder enters the tunnel and the rear door closes and opens at about
    <span class="math inline">\(t=56ns\)</span>.</p>
    <p><img src="./pictures/LadderTunnel2.png">
    <img src="./pictures/LadderTunnel4.png"></p>
    <p>So we again find that, while the ordering of events differs
    significantly in both frames, both agree on what ultimately happens
    to the ladder and the tunnel&amp;emdash;and we find that these
    aren’t really paradoxes at all, we’re just used to thinking of
    things in very nonrelatavistic terms.</p>
