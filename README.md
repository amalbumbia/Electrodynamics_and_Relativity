## About this Repository
This repository serves as a final project for the PHY 352L Classical Electrodynamics II class at UT Austin under Prof. Michael Downer. The motivation behind this project is to develop a pedagogical resource for understanding and visualizing a variety of topics under the umbrella of electrodynamics and relativity as it is a subject that is not nearly as intuitive compared to other areas of physics. There is a notable lack of approachable resources on advanced physics topics that are of high quality to be useful to an undergraduate or graduate student without essentially being a dense textbook or long set of lecture notes. 

## References

Here are some books we believe are great references for practice problems and more depth into electrodynamics and relativity! Many of these will sound familiar. 

Textbooks:
- Introduction to Electrodynamics by David J. Griffiths -- This book is conventionally used for upper undergraduate level courses.
- Classical Electrodynamics by John David Jackson -- This book is conventionally used for graduate classes.
- [Electromagnetism by G. L. Pollack and D. R. Stump](https://web.pa.msu.edu/people/stump/EM/chaps.html) -- Created by professors at MSU. They link all the chapters!
- A Traveler's Guide to Spacetime by Thomas Moore -- Struggling with special relativity? This book provides a wonderful overview of the topic and is quite short!
- [An Introduction to General Relativity: Spacetime and Geometry by Sean Carroll](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/grnotes/) -- The classic textbook for a graduate level GR class. It started as a set of linked lecture notes.

Lecture Notes: 

- [David Tong](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/em.html) -- This site hosts all of David Tong's lecture notes, including those on electrodynamics and relativity. These are an amazing resource.
