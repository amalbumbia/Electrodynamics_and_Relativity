## Why do we need to account for relativity in electrodynamics?

When you first learned about electromagnetism, chances are it was treated classically. However, by this point you probably know that there is always more to the core ideas typically discussed in undergraduate-level classes. 
Taking a second semester of electrodynamics may be the first time you encounter the idea that electrodynamic fields may be considered collectively, through a quantum perspective, or treated relativistically. It's possible you were not taught special relativity properly. And it's very likely that gauge theory is not something you encountered in other classes. This is all ok! Considering electrodynamics with relativity can be difficult to wrap your head around - afterall, neither are particularly intuitive or approachable in many cases. Before you (hopefully) use this repository to help you build a better understanding of this topic, we find it important to motivate relativistic electrodynamics. Why do we need it?

The breifest answer is that non-relativistic electrodynamics is just not a complete formalism that accounts for every physical system. It is quite limited in terms of the simplifications you tend to have to apply to a system so that it can be solved. When we progress to considering real particles, things get complicated fast. Not accounting for relativistic effects means that theoretical predictions may significantly deviate form real-life observations. 

A pretty interesting particle to think about is the muon.

## About this Repository
This repository serves as a final project for the PHY 352L Classical Electrodynamics II class at UT Austin under Prof. Michael Downer. The motivation behind this project is to develop a pedagogical resource for understanding and visualizing a variety of topics under the umbrella of electrodynamics and relativity as it is a subject that is not nearly as intuitive compared to other areas of physics. There is a notable lack of approachable resources on advanced physics topics that are of high quality to be useful to an undergraduate or graduate student without essentially being a dense textbook or long set of lecture notes. 

## References

Here are some books we believe are great references for practice problems and more depth into electrodynamics and relativity! Many of these will sound familiar. 

Textbooks:
- Introduction to Electrodynamics by David J. Griffiths -- This book is conventionally used for upper undergraduate level courses.
- Classical Electrodynamics by John David Jackson -- This book is conventionally used for graduate classes.
- [Electromagnetism by G. L. Pollack and D. R. Stump](https://web.pa.msu.edu/people/stump/EM/chaps.html) -- Created by professors at MSU. They link all the chapters!
- A Traveler's Guide to Spacetime by Thomas Moore -- Struggling with special relativity? This book provides a wonderful overview of the topic and is quite short!
- [An Introduction to General Relativity: Spacetime and Geometry by Sean Carroll](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/grnotes/) -- The classic textbook for a graduate level GR class. It started as a set of linked lecture notes.

Lecture Notes: 

- [David Tong](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/em.html) -- This site hosts all of David Tong's lecture notes, including those on electrodynamics and relativity. These are an amazing resource.
