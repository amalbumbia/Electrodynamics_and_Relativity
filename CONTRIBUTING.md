3. Ensure that your files and file names are organized and clear. Try to follow the existing repo structure.

The scope of this repository is intended to remain close to its name - "Electrodynamics and Relativity". Creative applications of these concepts to other areas of physics are welcome, 
however, they must be listed under the ``Applications" folder to avoid mixing up complex ideas with fundamental content acutely relevant to a higher-level/graduate-level course in electrodynamics. 

In this vein, fundamental electrodynamics concepts that would be appropriate for an upper-division undergraduate course should be referenced as needed rather than fully explained with their own modules. If you intend
to create a seperate pedagogical repository to cover these concepts, or a repository to cover additional areas of physics, we encourage you to do so and let us know so that we may credit you and link your work as a resource :)
