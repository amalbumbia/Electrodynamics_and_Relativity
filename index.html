            <h1>A Pedagogical Dive into Electrodynamics and Relativity</h1>
            <h2>About this Repository</h2>
            <p>This repository serves as a final project for the PHY 352L Classical Electrodynamics II 
                class at UT Austin under Prof. Michael Downer. 
                The motivation behind this project is to develop a pedagogical resource for
                 understanding and visualizing a variety of topics under the umbrella of electrodynamics
                  and relativity as it is a subject that is not nearly as intuitive compared to other 
                  areas of physics. There is a notable lack of approachable resources on advanced 
                  physics topics that are of high quality to be useful to an undergraduate or graduate 
                  student without essentially being a dense textbook or long set of lecture notes. We
                  hope you enjoy exploring this resource! </p>

            <h2>Why do we need to account for relativity in electrodynamics?</h2>
                <p>When you first learned about electromagnetism, chances are it was treated classically.
            However, by this point you probably know that there is always more to the core ideas typically discussed in undergraduate-level classes. 
                Taking a second semester of electrodynamics may be the first time you encounter the idea that electrodynamic fields may be considered collectively, through a quantum perspective, or treated relativistically. 
            It's possible you were not taught special relativity properly. And it's very likely that gauge theory is not something you encountered in other classes. This is all ok! Considering electrodynamics
            with relativity can be difficult to wrap your head around - afterall, neither are particularly intuitive or approachable in many cases. Before you (hopefully) use this repository to help you build a better 
            understanding of this topic, we find it important to motivate relativistic electrodynamics. Why do we need it?</p>
                
                <p>The breifest answer is that non-relativistic electrodynamics is just not a complete formalism that accounts for every physical system. It is quite limited in terms of the simplifications you tend to have to apply to a system so that it can be solved.
                    When we progress to considering real particles, things get complicated fast. 
                    Not accounting for relativistic effects means that theoretical predictions may significantly deviate form real-life observations. </p>

            <h2>References and Resources</h2>
            <p>
                Here are some books we believe are great references for practice problems and
                more depth into electrodynamics and relativity! Many of these will sound familiar.
