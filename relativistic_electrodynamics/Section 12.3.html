    <h1 id="relativistic-electrodynamics">Relativistic
    Electrodynamics</h1>
    <h2 id="a-reassurance">A Reassurance:</h2>
    <p>The term ‘Relativistic Electrodynamics’ may come off as quite
    intimidating; you may think that electrodynamics is hard enough, and
    accounting for relativity at the same time would make our lives even
    harder. However, you are fortunately very wrong!</p>
    <ul>
    <li>First of all, Maxwell’s equations and the Lorentz force law are
    already invariant between inertial reference frames. So, we do not
    have to alter the equations based on the reference frame, we just
    need to determine how the fields and field sources transform</li>
    <li>We get to see how electric and magnetic fields are
    interconnected - while one observer will attribute some particle
    motion to an electric field, an observer in a different frame will
    attribute it to a magnetic field. In this way, we see how
    electricity and magnetism can not exist without the other!</li>
    <li>As we fit our electrodynamic variables into Minkowski space (as
    we have for mechanics) we will find that our equations get compacted
    into really nice tensor equations.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="field-transformations">Field Transformations</h2>
    <p>Our entire field formulation of classical electrodynamics hinges
    on the statement that the field at a particular point should be able
    to give us all the information needed to calculate forces on the
    particle; that is, we dont need to know anything about the field
    sources. This means that if we want to find out how fields
    transform, we have our pick of field sources and our derived
    transformation rule will apply to fields caused by any other source.
    So, let us turn to our old friend the capacitor!</p>
    <p>In its own rest frame, the capacitor has a constant electric
    field in between the plates oriented perpendicular to the plates.
    Let’s see what happens in a reference frame <span
    class="math inline">\(S\)</span> moving at velocity <span
    class="math inline">\(v_0\)</span> laterally relative to the
    capacitor:</p>
    <figure>
    <img src="v_0_capacitor.png" alt="reference frame S" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">reference frame <span
    class="math inline">\(S\)</span></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Since the capacitor plates are moving, length contraction
    increases the surface charge, thereby increases the electric field
    amplitude by a factor of <span
    class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>.</p>
    <p>Also, since the charged plates are moving, we now have surface
    current <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{K}\)</span>, which
    produces a magnetic field!.</p>
    <p>Now we can compare the fields <span
    class="math inline">\(E_y\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(B_z\)</span> of reference frame <span
    class="math inline">\(S\)</span> to the fields <span
    class="math inline">\(\overline{E}_y\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(\overline{B}_z\)</span> in reference frame
    <span class="math inline">\(\overline{S}\)</span> which is moving at
    <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> velocity relative to <span
    class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and at <span
    class="math inline">\(\overline{v}\)</span> relative to the rest
    frame of the capacitor:</p>
    <figure>
    <img src="overline_v_capacitor.png"
    alt="reference frame \overline{S} - picture is an example of when v &gt; 0" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">reference frame <span
    class="math inline">\(\overline{S}\)</span> - picture is an example
    of when <span class="math inline">\(v &gt; 0\)</span></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>We conclude the following transformation rules:</p>
    <p><span class="math display">\[
    \begin{align}
        \overline{E}_y &amp;= \gamma(E_y - vB_z) \\
        \overline{B}_z &amp;= \gamma(B_z - \frac{v}{c^2}E_y) \\
    \end{align}
    \]</span></p>
    <p>Considering the same capacitor rotated by <span
    class="math inline">\(\pi/2\)</span> around thr <span
    class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis gives us analogous
    transformation rules for <span class="math inline">\(E_z\)</span>
    and <span class="math inline">\(B_y\)</span>:</p>
    <p><span class="math display">\[
    \begin{align}
        \overline{E}_z &amp;= \gamma(E_z + vB_y) \\
        \overline{B}_y &amp;= \gamma(B_y + \frac{v}{c^2}E_z) \\
    \end{align}
    \]</span></p>
    <p>Now, if we consider our original the capacitor rotated by <span
    class="math inline">\(\pi/2\)</span>,
    then the length contraction only affects the distance between the
    plates - since the electric field does not depend on that, we have
    <span class="math inline">\(\overline{E}_x = E_x\)</span>. Also, the
    symmetry of the plates means that there is no magnetic field in any
    inertial reference frame, so we will need another field source to
    study how <span class="math inline">\(B_x\)</span> transforms. We
    will now turn to our friend the solenoid!</p>
    <div style="position:relative; padding-bottom:75%; height:0; overflow:hidden;">
      <iframe
        src="../interactive/solenoid_3d_embed.html"
        title="Solenoid 3D Simulation"
        style="position:absolute; top:0; left:0; width:100%; height:100%; border:0;"
        loading="lazy"
      ></iframe>
    </div>
    <p>As you can see, in a reference frame moving at <span
    class="math inline">\(v\)</span> relative to the solenoid, the
    solenoid experiences length contraction and the density of coils
    increases by a factor of <span
    class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>. However, it also experiences
    time dilation, which decreases the current by a factor of <span
    class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> as well. These cancel out to
    give us the transformation rule <span
    class="math inline">\(\overline{B_x} = B_x\)</span>.</p>
    <h2 id="minkowski-space">Minkowski Space</h2>
    <p>If you are familiar with Quantum Mechanics, you remember the
    Hilbert Space, and how we dealt with kets (row vectors), bras
    (column vectors) and operators (matrices acting on keta/bras) inside
    the Hilbert Space. Well, in special relativity we have Minkowski
    space! Let me tell you the main characters of the Minkowski
    space:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><strong>4-vectors</strong>: examples include displacement
    <span class="math inline">\((ct, x, y, z)\)</span>, proper velocity,
    proper momentum, current density (will be formulated below)</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Minkowski metric</strong>: matrix (<span
    class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span>) that defines the inner product:
    Given two 4-vectors <span class="math inline">\(X^\mu\)</span> and
    <span class="math inline">\(Y^\mu\)</span>, their inner product in
    Minkowski space is <span
    class="math inline">\(X^\mu\eta_{\mu\nu}Y^\nu\)</span></p></li>
    <li><p><strong>4-covectors</strong>: Instead of having to write
    <span class="math inline">\(\eta_{\mu\nu}\)</span> over and over
    again, we will simply embed it into our vectors. Let the covector
    <span class="math inline">\(X_\mu\)</span> be defined by:</p>
    <p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
    X_\mu &amp;= \eta_{\mu\nu}X^\nu
    \end{align}
    \]</span></p>
    <p>Similarly,</p>
    <p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
    X^\nu &amp;= X_\mu\eta^{\mu\nu}
    \end{align}
    \]</span></p>
    <p>Now, there is deeper mathematical meaning to this, these
    covectors actually live in a dual space to Minkowski space. But the
    main cool convenience to us physicists is that now as long as all of
    our indices are paired (one superscripted, one subscripted), we know
    it is invariant between reference frames (since the Minkowski metric
    is invariant). Later, we are going to rewrite Maxwell’s equations in
    tensor form, and the paired indices will prove to us that the
    equations are invariant!</p>
    <p>One useful covector to keep in mind is the
    <em>four-derivative</em> (the relativistic form of <span
    class="math inline">\(\nabla\)</span>):</p>
    <p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
    \partial_\mu &amp;= \left(\frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial}{\partial t},
    \nabla\right)
    \end{align}\]</span></p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Lorentz group</strong>: This is the group of possible
    transformation matrices <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span>
    that transform 4-vectors into other 4-vectors while preserving the
    Minkowski inner product; that is,</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
      \Lambda^\rho_\mu\eta_{\rho\sigma}\Lambda^\sigma_\nu &amp;=
    \eta_{\mu\nu}
      \end{align}\]</span></p>
    <p>Therefore, if we have <span class="math inline">\((X&#39;)^\mu =
    \Lambda^\mu_\nu X^\nu\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\((Y&#39;)^\mu = \Lambda^\mu_\nu Y^\nu\)</span>,
    then</p>
    <p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
      (X&#39;)_\mu (Y&#39;)^\mu &amp;= (X&#39;)^\rho \eta_{\rho\mu}
    (Y&#39;)^\mu \\
      &amp;= X^\sigma \Lambda^\rho_\sigma \eta_{\rho\mu}
    \Lambda^\mu_\lambda Y^\lambda\\
      &amp;= X^\sigma \eta_{\sigma\lambda} Y^\lambda\\
      &amp;= X_\lambda Y^\lambda
      \end{align}\]</span></p>
    <p>Thus, the inner product stays the same even after transforming
    <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. Again, this means that any
    expression involving our vector/covectors and <span
    class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span> is invariant as long as all
    indices are in pairs. There are two main types of Lorentz
    transformations:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><em>Rotations</em>: Reference frames rotated with respect to
    one another</p></li>
    <li><p><em>Lorentz boosts</em>: Reference frames moving along an
    axis with respect to one another</p></li>
    <li><p>Any linear combination on the above type of Lorentz
    transformations is also a Lorentz transformation</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Tensors</strong>: A tensor is a very generalized
    4-vector, with not just one indice up or down, but any possible
    amount of superscripted and/or subscripted indices. It forms by
    carrying out dyad products between vectors and/or covectors (and
    then possibly having a linear combination of different dyads).
    Instead of cancelling out indice pairs to represent decreasing in
    dimension like an inner product does, the dyad product between two
    vectors/covectors keeps all their indices, so it increases in
    dimension from its multiplied parts. The Tensor transforms as
    follows:</p>
    <p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
    (T&#39;)^{\mu_1 ... \mu_n}_{\nu_1 ... \nu_m} &amp;=
    \Lambda^{\mu_1}_{\rho_1} ... \Lambda^{\mu_n}_{\rho_n}
    \Lambda^{\sigma_1}_{\nu_1} ... \Lambda^{\sigma_m}_{\nu_m} T^{\rho_1
    ... \rho_n}_{\sigma_1 ... \sigma_m}
    \end{align}\]</span></p></li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="fitting-electrodynamics-into-minkowski-space">Fitting
    Electrodynamics into Minkowski space</h2>
    <p>Now, lets take a look at our transformation rules for <span
    class="math inline">\(E\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(B\)</span> fields, as see how to represent
    that as a quantity that Lorentz tranforms in Minkowski space. The
    electric and magnetic field have a total of 6 components, so that
    can’t fit into a 4-vector? And the transformation rules look
    different from the 4-vector transformation rules anyway, so what is
    happening here? Let us turn to the potentials. We have</p>
    <p><span class="math display">\[E = -\nabla\phi - \frac{\partial
    \textbf{A}}{\partial t} \text{ and } B = \nabla \times
    \textbf{A}\]</span></p>
    <p>With some flexibility in how to define <span
    class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>:</p>
    <p><span class="math display">\[\phi \to \phi-\frac{\partial
    \chi}{\partial t} \text{ and } \textbf{A} \to \textbf{A} +
    \nabla\chi\]</span>.</p>
    <p>We can put these potentials into a 4-vector that transforms as
    so:</p>
    <p><span class="math display">\[A^\mu = \left(\begin{array}
    &amp; \phi/c \\
    \textbf{A}
    \end{array}\right) \to A^\mu - \partial^\mu \chi\]</span></p>
    <p>Now consider the <span
    class="math inline">\(\textbf{anitsymmetric rank 2 tensor}\)</span>:</p>
    <p><span class="math display">\[F_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu A_\nu -
    \partial_\nu A_\mu\]</span></p>
    <p>What’s an antisymmetric tensor?</p>
    <p><span class="math display">\[
    F_{\mu\nu} = \left\{
    \begin{array}
    &amp; 0 &amp; F_{10} &amp; F_{20} &amp; F_{30} \\
    -F_{10} &amp; 0 &amp; F_{12} &amp; F_{13} \\
    -F_{20} &amp; -F_{12} &amp; 0 &amp; F_{23} \\
    -F_{30} &amp; -F_{13} &amp; -F_{23} &amp; 0 \\
    \end{array} \right\}
    \]</span></p>
    <ul>
    <li><em>Antisymmetric</em>: <span class="math inline">\(t^{\mu\nu} =
    t^{\nu\mu}\)</span>, while <span class="math inline">\(t^{\mu\mu} =
    0\)</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p>As you can see, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> has 6
    distinct elements, and we can show that the vairous elements are
    elements of the <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(B\)</span> fields. For example,:</p>
    <p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
    F_{10} &amp;= \partial_1 A_0 - \partial_0 A_1 \\
    &amp;= \nabla \phi/c - \frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial A_x}{\partial t} \\
    &amp;= E_x/c \\
    \end{align*}\]</span></p>
    <p>When we Lorentz transform <span
    class="math inline">\(F_{\mu\nu}\)</span>, we also get the same
    transformation rules we derived earlier with our capacitors and
    solenoids zooming at arbitrary velocities.</p>
    <p>Thus, we can represent the <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>
    and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> fields and how they
    transform as the field tensor <span
    class="math inline">\(F_{\mu\nu}\)</span>.</p>
    <p><span class="math display">\[
    F_{\mu\nu} = \left\{
    \begin{array}
    &amp; 0 &amp; E_x/c &amp; E_y/c &amp; E_z/c \\
    -E_x/c &amp; 0 &amp; -B_z &amp; B_y \\
    -E_y/c &amp; B_z &amp; 0 &amp; -B_x \\
    -E_z/c &amp; -B_y &amp; B_x &amp; 0 \\
    \end{array} \right\}
    \]</span></p>
    <h2 id="dual-tensor">Dual Tensor</h2>
    <p>We need yet another tensor in order to formulate Maxwell’s
    equations. And we will create it using the antisymmetric tensor
    <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\)</span>,
    defined as:</p>
    <p><span class="math display">\[\epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} =
    \begin{cases}
    1 \;\text{if $\mu\nu\rho\sigma = 0123$} \\
    -1 \;\text{if $\mu\nu\rho\sigma = 3210$} \\
    0 \;\text{if any indices are equal}
    \end{cases}\]</span></p>
    <p>This is like the generalized Levi-Civita symbol. Now let us
    define</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(G^{\mu\nu} = \frac{1}{2}
    \epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} F_{\rho\sigma}\)</span></p>
    <p>We will call this the ‘dual electromagnetic tensor’</p>
    <h2 id="current-density">Current Density</h2>
    <p>We have one last step before we can rewrite the Maxwell’s
    equations in terms of <span
    class="math inline">\(F_{\mu\nu}\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(G_{\mu\nu}\)</span>. We need to put current
    and current density in 4-vector form:</p>
    <p><span class="math display">\[J^\mu = \left(\begin{array}
    &amp; \rho c \\
    \textbf{J}
    \end{array}\right)\]</span></p>
    <p>Consider <span class="math inline">\(J^\mu = (\rho_0 c,
    0)\)</span>. Under a Lorentz boost it becomes</p>
    <p><span class="math display">\[\Lambda^\mu_\nu J^\mu =
    \left(\begin{array}
    &amp; \gamma \rho_0 c \\
    -\gamma \rho_0 v
    \end{array}\right)\]</span></p>
    <p>This makes physical sense, as the charge density would increase
    due to lorentz contraction, and in the frame moving at <span
    class="math inline">\(\textbf{v}\)</span> this new charge density
    <span class="math inline">\(\gamma \rho_0\)</span> is moving at
    <span class="math inline">\(-\textbf{v}\)</span>, thereby causing
    there to be a nonzero current density.</p>
    <h2 id="the-new-maxwells-equations">The New Maxwell’s
    Equations:</h2>
    <p>Now, we finally have Maxwell’s equations:</p>
    <p><span class="math display">\[\partial_\mu F^{\mu\nu} = \mu_0
    J^\nu \text{ and } \partial_\mu G^{\mu\nu} = 0\]</span></p>
    <p>Note that there is a hanging <span
    class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span> in each of thses equations. You
    may think this is a problem, since it indicates that these equations
    are not necessarily invariant. That is correct, but it turns out
    that Maxwell’s equations will tranform into eachother in different
    reference frames. By that I mean that Gauss’s Law in one reference
    frame turns into Ampere’s Law in the other, and vice versa. So,
    while these equations transform, it is in a way that does not make a
    difference. We say that they are covariant under Lorentz
    tranformations.</p>
