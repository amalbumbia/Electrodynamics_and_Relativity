    <h1 id="section-12.2.1-proper-time-and-proper-velocity">Proper Time and Proper Velocity</h1>
    <p> Let’s again consider the effects of time
    dilation. However, let’s now consider a differential time step of
    <span class="math display">\[
    d\tau = dt \sqrt{1 - \frac{u^2}{c^2}}
    \]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> is the
    proper time. According to Griffiths, this makes sense if you’re a
    French person because “propre” means your own. Since this is in your
    own frame, it will always be invariant, making it useful in the
    regard. The difference between the two is pretty straightforward. We
    have ordinary velocity, which is length in some external reference
    frame (coordinate distance) over time in that same frame (coordinate
    frame): <span class="math display">\[
    {u} = \frac{d{l}}{dt}
    \]</span> But coordinate time may not always the most relevant to
    you, perhaps you’re more interested in how much distance you travel
    in this external frame over YOUR time: <span class="math display">\[
    {\eta}=\frac{d{l}}{d\tau}
    \]</span> If we insert these into our equation that relates these
    differential time steps, we get: <span class="math display">\[
    {\eta} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}} {u}
    \]</span> Since the proper time is our own time, it transforms very
    simply from one inertial system to another. Starting with <span
    class="math display">\[
    \eta^\mu = \frac{dx^\mu}{d\tau}
    \]</span> When transforming from system <span
    class="math inline">\(S\)</span> to system <span
    class="math inline">\(\bar{S}\)</span> that moves at speed <span
    class="math inline">\(v\)</span> along the common <span
    class="math inline">\(x\bar{x}\)</span> axis, we accordinly get the
    equations [Griffiths 12.18] <span class="math display">\[
    \bar{t} = \gamma (t - \frac{v}{c^2}x) \\
    \bar{x} = \gamma (x - v t) \\
    \bar{y} = y \\
    \bar{z} = z
    \]</span> with the derivatives applied using the differential proper
    time interval <span class="math display">\[
    \bar{t} = \gamma (\eta^0 - \beta\eta^1) \\
    \bar{\eta}^1 = \gamma (\eta^1 - \beta \eta^0) \\
    \bar{\eta}^2 = \eta^2 \\
    \bar{\eta}^3 = \eta^3
    \]</span> To become more acquainted with notation in the literature,
    this is <span class="math display">\[
    \bar{\eta}^\mu = \Lambda^\mu_\nu \eta^\nu
    \]</span> using a tensor contraction. The transformation rules for
    ordinary velocity require a change in both differentials and can be
    found in the book. </p>
    <p>Let’s make things more interesting by talking about the <span
    style="color:red">Relativistic Doppler effect</span> (refer to the
    associated html to play around with a simple plot of this). The
    equations describing this phenomenon take on a slightly new form, so
    let’s derive it. Consider a source moving towards a stationary
    observer.</p>
    <p>We will first make use of the Lorentz transformations: <span
    class="math display">\[
    \bar{t} = \gamma(t - \frac{vx}{c^2})
    \]</span> and <span class="math display">\[
    \bar{x} = \gamma(x - vt)
    \]</span></p>
    <p>Firstly, by convention, <span class="math inline">\(v \rightarrow
    -v\)</span> since the source is moving towards the observer.
    Secondly, let’s say we have two events that occur at <span
    class="math inline">\((0,0)\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\((\tau,0)\)</span> in the source’s rest frame,
    where <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> is the period of the
    wave in the source’s frame. WLOG and for convenience, we can say
    that the observer and source experience the event at <span
    class="math inline">\((0,0)\)</span> simulataneously.<br />
    The second spacetime event, which does not occur simulataneously,
    thereby transforms to <span class="math display">\[
    \bar{t} = \gamma(t - \frac{vx}{c^2}) = \gamma\tau
    \]</span> and <span class="math display">\[
    \bar{x} = \gamma(x - vt) = \gamma v \tau
    \]</span> Meaning that the second event occurs at <span
    class="math inline">\((\gamma\tau,\gamma v \tau)\)</span> in the
    observer’s frame. Because the event is spatially at a distance <span
    class="math inline">\(\gamma v \tau\)</span>, the observer has to
    wait not only for the event to occur in their frame but ALSO the
    time it takes for the light to travel that distance, <span
    class="math inline">\(\gamma v \tau /c\)</span>; therefore, the
    observer sees the signal at <span class="math display">\[
    \tau_{obs} = \gamma\tau_{src} + \gamma v \tau_{src}/c
    \]</span> Since <span class="math inline">\(\tau_{obs} =
    1/f_{obs}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tau_{src} =
    1/f_{src}\)</span>, we can rearrange to get:</p>
    <p><span class="math display">\[
    \frac{f_{src}}{f_{obs}} = \gamma(1 + v/c) = \frac{1+
    v/c}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}} = \frac{1+ v/c}{\sqrt{(1-v/c)(1+v/c))}} =
    \sqrt{\frac{1+v/c}{1-v/c}}
    \]</span> Another derivation may not seem very interesting, but this
    is relevant to astrophysics and relativistic beaming, in which
    relativistic aberration, time dilation, and the doppler shifting can
    affect the apparent brightness of a source.</p>
