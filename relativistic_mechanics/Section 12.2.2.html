    <p>(I don’t get the joke this meme is trying to make and that makes
    it funnier) Noether’s Theorem regarding conservation of momentum is
    sacred and can never be broken (see problem 12.29 in Griffiths); as
    such, we define relativistic momentum as:</p>
    <p><span class="math display">\[
    {p} = m{\eta} = \frac{m{u}}{\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}}
    \]</span></p>
    <p>In 4-vector notation, this is:</p>
    <p><span class="math display">\[
    p^\mu = m \eta^\mu
    \]</span></p>
    <p>Einstein also defines: <span class="math display">\[
    p^0c \equiv E \equiv \frac{mc^2}{\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}}
    \]</span></p>
    <p>Famously, as you have probably heard before, even the mass at
    rest has energy. Evaluating this at <span
    class="math inline">\(u=0\)</span> gives: <span
    class="math display">\[
    E_{rest}=mc^2
    \]</span></p>
    <p>Everything else that isn’t the rest energy is kinetic; therefore,
    <span class="math display">\[
    E_{kin} = E - E_{rest} = \frac{mc^2}{\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}} - mc^2
    \]</span> What’s very nice is that in the nonrelativistic regime
    <span class="math inline">\(u &lt;&lt; c\)</span>, we can Taylor
    expand the square root and recover <span class="math display">\[
    E_{kin} \approx \frac{1}{2}mu^2 \text{   ; $u &lt;&lt; c$}
    \]</span> This is vital to all theories in the sense that we must
    check that our new theories can recover our established equation and
    rules. This is similar to the classical theory of gravity in that we
    recover <span class="math inline">\(F=-mg\hat{z}\)</span> for
    objects that are close to the Earth. We cannot have our new theories
    be incompatible with our old ones without some clever
    explanation.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, we arrive at: <span class="math display">\[
    E^2 - p^2c^2 = m^2c^4
    \]</span></p>
    <h3 id="bonus">BONUS!</h3>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(c = 3 \times 10^8\)</span> m/s makes
    you happy, doesn’t it? What if I made you unhappy by making <span
    class="math inline">\(c=1\)</span>? Although, Griffiths doesn’t have
    a chance to touch on this, it’s important to talk about <span
    style="color:red">natural units</span>, because they come up often
    in relativistic particle physics and other fields where relativistic
    frames are typical. Essentially, a simplification is made where
    <span class="math inline">\(c=1\)</span> in order so that constants
    don’t obscure the algebra. The idea is that we can simply add them
    back later via simple dimensional analysis. In particle physics,
    this has the consequence of rendering our equation <span
    class="math display">\[
    E^2 - p^2 = m^2
    \]</span> Where [E] = [GeV], [p]=[GeV/c], and [m]=[GeV/c^2] also
    becomes [E] = [GeV], [p]=[GeV], and [m]=[GeV]. With natural units,
    GeV now becomes energy, momentum, or mass depending on the context.
    If we want to go back to normal units, we can just multiply by the
    appropriate 1, <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, or <span
    class="math inline">\(c^2\)</span> respectively.</p>
